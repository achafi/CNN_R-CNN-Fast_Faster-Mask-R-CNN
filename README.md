Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural network (DNN) wich is widely used for computer vision or NLP. During the training process, the network's building blocks are repeatedly altered in order for the network to reach optimal performance and to classify images and objects as accurately as possible. 
Convolutional neural networks excel at learning the spacial structure in input data.
